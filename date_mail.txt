Dear DATE,
 

I need your help with my affiliation mistake. I submitted my paper to DATE 2015.
The title of my paper was "Subpage Programming for Extending the Lifetime of NAND Flash Memory" 
Now, the paper is published by DATE URL webpage, "https://www.date-conference.com/proceedings-archive/2015/html/0654.html".

Three years are passed, however, I have written a new paper as the first author by referring my DATE 2015 paper.
The new paper has accepted from a journal.
 
But, I have a problem with my affiliation in DATE 2015 as the first author.
My department of the university wants me to add "Sunkyunkwan University" to my affiliation on that DATE URL webpage.
That is for my graduation of the university. Please.

At that time, I have been a student of Sunkyunkwan University and a engineer of Samsung Corp.
If it needs to be proved, I can send you Certificate of Sunkyunkwan University Enrollment in 2015.

Could you change Jung-Hoon Kim_superscript(1) to Jung-Hoon Kim_superscript(13) on that DATE URL webpage?

In a Web Page,
Current   : Jung-Hoon Kim1, Sang-Hoon Kim2 and Jin-Soo Kim3
Correction: Jung-Hoon Kim13, Sang-Hoon Kim2 and Jin-Soo Kim3

Alternatively, I can also change my camera-ready paper and send the paper to DATE.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you so much for all of your help.

If you are not managing paper's affiliation, could you forward this e-mail to him who manages this, please?
I am sorry but I need your help, please.


Sincerely,
Jung-Hoon Kim.

Dear Jung-Hoon Kim,

 

Unfortunately at DATE we cannot help you as your proceedings were already submitted for publication in 2015 at IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library, who are the ones that own the copyright of your publication since that moment onwards. Therefore, 
in order to verify if your affiliation can be modified, you need to contact them directly and make the request to them,
which are the only ones that could update the affiliation in their on-line libraries, but we cannot help from the DATE side

 


Best regards,

 David Atienza, 

DATE 2015 PC Chair.

Dear Andreas,

 

Thank you for replying kindly.

 

If the problem is the sync, alternatively, 

after only updating my affiliation, I can send my camera-ready paper which was submitted to DATE 2015.

The modification is just the affiliation, not the others.

 

The affiliation was mandatory for me to graduate from the university.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

I am sorry, I need your help.

 

 

Sincerely,

Jung-Hoon Kim
