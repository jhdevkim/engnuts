Dear DATE,
 

I need your help with my affiliation mistake. I submitted my paper to DATE 2015.
The title of my paper was "Subpage Programming for Extending the Lifetime of NAND Flash Memory" 
Now, the paper is published by DATE URL webpage, "https://www.date-conference.com/proceedings-archive/2015/html/0654.html".

Three years passed, however, I have written a new paper as the first author by referring my DATE 2015 paper.
The new paper has accepted from a journal.
 
But, I have a problem with my affiliation in DATE 2015 as the first author.
My department of the university wants me to add "Sunkyunkwan University" to my affiliation on that DATE URL webpage.
That is for my graduation of the university. Please~~.
At that time, I have been a student of Sunkyunkwan University and a engineer of Samsung Corp.
If it needs to be proved, I can send you Certificate of Sunkyunkwan University Enrollment in 2015.
Could you change Jung-Hoon Kim_superscript(1) to Jung-Hoon Kim_superscript(13) on that DATE URL webpage?

Current   : Jung-Hoon Kim1, Sang-Hoon Kim2 and Jin-Soo Kim3
Correction: Jung-Hoon Kim13, Sang-Hoon Kim2 and Jin-Soo Kim3

I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you so much for all of your help.

If you are not managing paper's affiliation, could you forward this e-mail to him who manages, please?
I am sorry but I need your help, please.
 

Sincerely,
Jung-Hoon Kim.
