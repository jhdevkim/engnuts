Table. II -> TABLE II
This is because all blocks -> This result is larger than that of uniform random access pattern. This is because the entire user space is filled with random writes.
This result show -> This result shows that

In addition, we -> We also
This is because the addi.. FTL -> This is because the number of FTL metadata entries is increased due to the subpage.

we define the weight ... -> we define the weight of endurance in SPFTL-BASE and SPFTL to 1 and 1 over 1.71, respectively
Due to SPFTL -> SPFTL N 먼저 언급 SPFTLN represents the normalized erase counts by DWI.

FTL usually ... eMMCs. ->FTL exploits the cache mechanism to handle the large amount of FTL metadata with very limited memory space in embedded storage devices.
However, the write amount of FTL metadata is excessive compared to the amount of modified by FTL operations, because of full page programming.
