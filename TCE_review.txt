Dear Jin-Soo Kim,

I regret to inform that your paper entitled 
"Utilizing Subpage Programming to Prolong the Lifetime of Embedded NAND Flash-based Storage" 
which was submitted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics cannot be published as it was submitted.


REVIEWER 1

This is an interesting paper, with some potential, but the paper fail to discuss the current state of the art. 
One example is that the latest CE research is 7 years old, a lot has changed since then. 
The authors are encouraged to improve their literature discussion.

- 현재 NAND 공정이 발전하면서, NAND Page 크기에 비례하여 수명이 감소하고 있는 추세이다~[ref:Subpage programming]. 
Planar NAND의 경우는 8KiB까지 Page 크기가 증가하였으며, V-NAND의 경우 Page는 16KiB까지 증가하여 device에 사용되고 있다. 
This wastes the limited lifespan of NAND flash-based storage devices 
by repeatedly writing the identical FTL metadata without any outcomes.


REVIEWER 2

The proposed paper presents a novel Flash Translation Layer with the introduction of subpage programming technique, 
in order to minimize the number of writings on NAND flash-based storages, hence increasing the durability of the device.

The paper is well written and structured, the language is clear.
However the innovative contribution is fair and focused on the subpage approach 
previously applied by the authors to a similar context.

Some noteworthy doubts arise from this first review,
hence some modifications are needed as well as an explaination of the relation of this paper with: http://koasas.kaist.ac.kr/handle/10203/221862

- 해당 논문의 기법은 cache buffer 상에서만 처리, subpage 방법이며, NAND의 page programming만 사용하므로,
  단어만 동일할 뿐, 본 논문의 subpage programing 기법과 다르다.

UNCLEAR/MISLEADING: In the introduction, you stated that : "FTL metadata writes[...] ranged from 28.1% to 46.7% of the total flash
writes", with the state-of-the-art (page-mapping) FTL in real use conditions. I would specify immediately that this results 
come from your experiments (as clarified in II.C). Then, in section V.B, you stated that: "the total amount of 
FTL metadata writes is 15.16GiB which is almost the same as the total amount of user writes [15.20GiB]", 
which is roughly coherent with the aforementioned statement.
Finally, you add that using SPFTL-BASE (which is not a state-of-the-art algorithm, but a proposal of yours): "We observe 
that the total amount of FTL metadata writes accounts for 5.80GiB in Pattern-A, which is 8.36 times of the data written by the user.
Similar to Pattern-A, Pattern-B and Pattern-C show the similar results." How do you explain this huge increase in FTL metadata writes?
Hence, why is the following reduction significant, given the fact that SPFTL-BASE presents the aforementioned huge increase 
in FTL metadata writes? "We can observe that SPFTL significantly decreases the amount of metadata writes for all the given traces.
Specifically, SPFTL reduces the amount by 43.5%, 43.3%, and 43.6% for Pattern-A, Pattern-B, and Pattern-C, respectively, 
compared to SPFTL-BASE". Reducing 43% of a quantity that is more than 8 times the data written by the user 
does not seem a good result, if compared with the state-of-the-art "FTL metadata writes[...] ranged from 28.1% to 46.7% of 
the total flash writes". Am I missing something? Please clarify and explain carefully this point.
Even in V.D, Fig.5 and Fig.6, every comparison seems between SPFTL and SPFTL-BASE (which are both proposals of yours), with no
comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.
So, even in conclusions, your results: "Our evaluation results with real I/O traces show that SPFTL reduces the average amount of
metadata written to the flash memory by up to 43.4%. As a result, we show that SPFTL improves the average lifetime of embedded NAND
flash-based storage devices by up to 18.4% in the environment composed of 20nm class NAND chips." seems to concern the comparison
between SPFTL and SPFTL-BASE, with no real comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

- GXT metadata를 host request마다 저장하도록 하는 버전이며 28.1%, 46.7% 메타데이터를 더 기록한다.
  본 논문에서 제안하는 SPFTL-BASE는 GXT metadata 저장을 최소화하였으며, 
  State-of-art와 동일 측정 상태에서도 SPFTL-BASE 8.3% 6.7% 11.0% 메타데이터를 기록하고 개선되었으므로, 
  3.9% 4.9% 6.3% SPFTL
  State-of-art와 비교할 필요가 없다. 따라서, SPFTL-BASE와 SPFTL만을 비교한다.
  In SPFTL-BASE, their amounts are lessened to 8.3%, 6.7%, and 11.0% of the total flash writes.
  And SPFTL also decreases their amounts to 4.9%, 3.9%, and 6.3% of the total flash writes.
  
MISSING: The introduction show a scarce presentation of the state-of-the-art, which is partially recovered at the end of the paper 
in the "Related Work" section. However, a brief presentation of the currently used FTL versions in the consumer electronics should
be added.

- 기존 작성된 내용이 있으며, 아래 단락을 Intro.에 추가
- There are three classes of FTL mapping granularities to deal with the address of
  NAND flash memory. Block-level and page-level mappings can be realized by dividing
  the total storage area into several blocks and pages respectively. Hybrid-level mapping
  is the combination of the block-level and page-level mappings. Depending on the
  class of mapping, FTL should create and manage own metadata to implement its mapping
  scheme.

MISSING: In this paper, you did not highlight that "Partial page programming (PP) [...] is not allowed in MLC-mode.", 
as you say in [7]. Assuming that this is still true, I think you should say it explicitly even in this paper. In addition, 
you say "We assume the blocks for metadata are operated in the SLC-mode [18], [19] whereas data blocks are in the MLC-mode. 
We believe that the proposed scheme can be incorporated in MLC or TLC metadata blocks without significant modifications.", 
hence this surely increases the value of your paper. Please add a brief explanation of problems (and, if possible, propose your solutions) in order to extend your algorithm to MLC and TLC blocks.

- MLC에서 Partial page programming은 기존 프로그램된 data에 영향을 주므로 불가능하다. 따라서, 우리는 이 PP 방법을 배제한다.
- Meta를 SLC만 사용하는 SPFTL 방법이 MLC, TLC에서도 가장 효과적이려면,
  SLC Meta 영역의 수명이 MLC, TLC로 사용되는 User 영역의 수명을 보장할 수 있어야 한다.

MISSING: Please underline the differences between SPFTL and partial page programming [17], explaining in detail why your approach 
is preferable. Numerical or experimental or simulation results are welcome in order to justify the advantages of SPFTL.

- 기존 [Supage 논문]에서 PP는 SLC Mode에서 단순 Page Programming보다 24%, 8% 수명이 낮다. 따라서, PP 방법은 사용하지 않는다.

MISSING: In V.C, you state that "the endurance of SP blocks is improved by 1.71 times due to subpage programming 
in the 20nm class NAND chips [7]", but I did not find explicitly that value in the paper. Could you clarify how the value "1.71" 
is calculated?

- 기존 [Supage 논문]에서 SLC-mode로 측정된 Fig. 8 Chip B의 SP2O_SLC의 수명 증가률(Normalized Endurance Cycle) 
  그래프에서 확인 가능하며, 1.71로 half-page 크기에서 가장 높은 수명을 보인다.

NOMENCLATURE: The renaming of SPFTL to SPFTL-BASE can be misleading, hence I suggest to use the complete name "SPFTL-BASE" 
since the beginning of the paper.

- Ok, it can be changed as SPFTL-BASE from the beginning

GRAMMAR: The paper is in general clear and well written, although I have found a few typos and grammar mistakes: - 
"metadata should be persist" -> "metadata should be persistent" - "to make the update persistent across a power cycles" -> 
"to make the update persistent across a power cycle"

- Ok
